# Handwriting_Recognition Using Neural Networks

## Attributes of OCR Texts
### Text density: on a printed/written page, text is dense. However, given an image of a street with a single street sign, text is sparse.
### Structure of text: text on a page is structured, mostly in strict rows, while text in the wild may be sprinkled everywhere, in different rotations.
### Fonts: printed fonts are easier, since they are more structured then the noisy hand-written characters.
### Character type: text may come in different language which may be very different from each other. Additionally, structure of text may be different from numbers, such as house numbers etc.
### Artifacts: clearly, outdoor pictures are much noisier than the comfortable scanner.
### Location: some tasks include cropped/centred text, while in others, text may be located in random locations in the image.
